# VideoColorization
This is my repo for the project **Automatic Video Colorization with Deep Learning** <br/>

In this project, I explored different encoder-decoder architectures for Image Colorization based on L*a*b* color space and created a framework for Automatic Video Colorization.
I cleaned the Places 365 dataset and trained 5 different models from scratch. I used VGG16 and ResNet50 for the transfer learning. Model M5 gave the best results with ResNet50 as the backbone. 


------------------
**TRAINED COLORIZATION NETWORKS:** <br/>
------------------
I trained a total of 5 image colorization networks (models M1 to M5) and developed a framework to adapt it for Video Colorization.<br/>
All the trained models are available in: [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G1y8EGjSEvJBssqf1bIsurxtI1YDItSk) 

Network Architecture: M1<br/>
Architecture followed in [[1]](https://xiangyutang2.github.io/auto-colorization-autoencoders/.) and similar to [[2]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03400
).<br/>
